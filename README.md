Abstract:
> Modern data science increasingly requires the integration of disparate tools, ranging from Python and R for analysis, Bash for system-level automation, and finally typesetting languages for generating final reports. This presentation explores using GNU Emacs and Org-mode as a polyglot notebook to aptly consolidate the research process under one roof.<br><br>In addition to the many tips and tricks which aim to streamline the adoption of the tools and methodologies herein, this presentation also contains a practical example of polyglot programming in action, from start to finish. The resulting data and files are readily hosted and properly integrated on a Git platform, properly versioned, openly accessible and freely reproducible from plaintext, whilst also being viewable on nearly any device or platform via ubiquitous HTML and PDF - with minimal additional effort.
