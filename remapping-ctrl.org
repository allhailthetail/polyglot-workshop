Because keyboards are designed around typing and not around our editors, odd issues like this can happen:
CTRL in normal computing isn't used quite as often as it is when running emacs. As a result, repeated
overextension of the pinkey finger can cause gnarly issues to arise with your hands. This little guide hopes to help anyone interested in Emacs to avoid months-long recovery of your hands (particularly the little finger)...

Unfortunately, remapping keys in Linux is  a bit of a chore and how to go about it "depends" on what flavor of Linux you like.

** Arch

** Debian/Ubuntu
- [[https://dev.to/tallesl/change-caps-lock-to-ctrl-3c4][Link to guide]]
#+begin_example bash
#/etc/default/keyboard

# NOTE: Comment out rather than replace, in case you want to go back...

# To swap Caps with ctrl:
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:swapcaps"

# to change JUST CAPSLOCK (leaving ctrl)
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"

# Apply the configuration (run in shell)
#sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
#+end_example
** KDE and More generally
#+begin_quote
Often, built-in GUI settings has keyboard options which usually allow you to change these settings.

By the way, this is how I like to display images in Org mode. I find it exports nicely to HTML this way, and have html-style controls (align, width, etc) right there in the header...

Emacs can actually /view/ images, so it's almost as easy to go, find the image, open&view it, and save the link to it and paste here:
1. Find/view the file =<SPC> .=
2. Save the location =<SPC> f y=
3. Change to previous buffer =<SPC> b p=
4. *Yank* the URL (from normal mode) =p=
5. (Optionally) convert to relative path... =C-l=
6. Add captions, formatting, etc?

* Personal Recommendation:
#+begin_quote
I highly recommend remapping _both_ ESC and CAPSLOCK if you're using Doom (evil) mode.
Train your other hand to use CTRL with some other finger?
